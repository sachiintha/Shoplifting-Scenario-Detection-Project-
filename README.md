# Shoplifting-Scenario-Detection-Project-


The "Shoplifting Scenario Detection" project is a large, complex effort to make stores safer and more visible to employees. The project is based on a Flask web application, which gives users an easy-to-use interface for monitoring and managing systems in real time. The main innovation is the addition of a custom Darknet model that has been trained very carefully to be very good at recognizing objects and behaviours that are unique to retail settings, with a focus on spotting possible shoplifting incidents. This Darknet model is the project's backbone, and it makes it possible for the system to quickly and accurately find objects. 
The project uses both the Darknet model and OpenCV to process images quickly and efficiently. This improves the quality of video feeds and images, which makes the system even more useful overall. TensorFlow's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has also been used for advanced object classification. This means that the system can not only find objects but also spot behaviours that might indicate shoplifting. So, stores can proactively find and deal with situations where people are shoplifting, which makes their stores safer and helps keep things from going missing. 
Combining cutting-edge technologies with an easy-to-use interface, this all-around approach gives retailers the tools they need to be more alert and quicker to act, making stores safer and preventing theft-related losses.
